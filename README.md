This is a Java based autoclicker, built with JavaFX, Jnativehook, and Java Native Access.

JavaFx is used for the GUI, Jnativehook is used to act as a global mouse and keyboard hook, and Java Native Access is used to send driver level clicks indistinguishable from normal mouse clicks. It also comes with a self destruct button that will close and delete the application, removing all traces.

One of it's main features is that it is hard for macro detection software to catch, as it randomizes the times between two values that the user specifies.
